    "    - 2)Frequency-domain methods: fundamental frequency, F0\n",
    "- Problematic algorithms\n",
    "    - Large errors are usually octave errors(one octave up or down) \n",
    "    - Pre- or post-processing may reduce errors\n",
    "        - For example, compression or spectral whitening of input signal, median filtering of a sequence of F0 estimates\n",
